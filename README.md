Currency Exchanger application that will allow user to get up to date currency exchange rates. They can also pick a date within the last 10 years and get the historical exchange rates. Users can see which countries use which currencies 

The two main apisâ€™ that I used were the Currency Converter by natkapral found here :

As well as the Rest Country api by apilayer found here: https://github.com/apilayer/restcountries
